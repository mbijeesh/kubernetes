Docker Image - package Template from which we can run multiple containers.
Node: Is a virtual or physical mchine where k8s is running. To avoid SPOF, use multiple nodes. So 3 nodes can form a k8s cluster.
Multiple nodes in cluster can share load as well. 
There is a master node in  the cluster which will decide in which worker node a container should run. 
So master node is the orchestration manager. 
K8s - installs :- 
API Server - Running on master node.  To interact with the k8s cluster by user. From the master node it communicate with the kubelet/agent in other worker nodes and carry out 
  the action requested by the worker node. 
etcd -  key value store, to store the information about mutiple nodes in a distributed manner. Will ensure no conflicts with the master. 
scheduler -   Running on master node. Assign the new container to nodes. 
controller  - Running on master node. Take decision when a node goes down and distribute the containers to other nodes. 
Container runtime - Running on the worker node. The container software, in our case the docker.  
kubelet  - the agent runs on each worker node in the cluster. It  ensuer the containers are running on the node as expected. 
# kubectl - command line interface  - can be 1 version difference with cluster. 

kubectl run hello-minikube
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
-----
Ways to setup/configure k8s:
Minikube  - single node k8s cluster  ( Try https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
microk8s 
kubeadm - to set up multi node  k8s cluster in local
ALso available in GCP/AWS/Azure
--
Minikube - comes with all services inside one bundle as a single node k8s cluster
can be download from internet
Then use virtual box. 
--

Before set up  we need to install kubectl 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/  
Check virtualization enabled 
grep -E --color 'vmx|svm' /proc/cpuinfo  
Install virtualbox in your ubuntu laptop.
The minikube installation create the VM automatically inside the virtual box.
See documentation 
minikube status
kubectl get nodes
#kubectl creaet deployment <name>  <image path>

#kubectl get deployments

#kubectl expose deploymnet <name> --type --port=
#minikube service name --url    > will give  the URL
#kubectl get pods
Access it,
